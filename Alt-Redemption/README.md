# Trash Plinko?

***Trash Plinko is still in development but may involve digital plinko with trash, controlled by a physical alternative controller... somehow...***


## Burger Plinko (*nomnomnom*)

*Prototype update! Now with food and controls!*

Moving forward with this prototype, we wanted to try out some basic interactivity on the unity side and reskin the idea. 

The 3 equivalent bins have been replaced with trash bins on the outside and a central collection bin, where you can see your items after they have passed through the plinko machine. There are now ingredients for burgers falling from the top and both the item dumper and player paddle at the bottom are controlled with left and right keyboard inputs. 

There isn't any formal goal built into this version of the prototype but attempting to get things into and *not* into the central bin is pretty fun. Plus seeing your collected ingredents at the bottom is an added bonus. 

Also a quick thanks to the people who made [these cute low-poly burger assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/food/low-poly-burger-pack-110019) on the unity store, they are so adorable and worked great to add some flare to this version of the prototype. (And not having me sucked into modeling them for fun and taking hours lol) ((sometimes you gotta spend $5 on digital burgers))

The sketch next to the prototype image has the vision for both a one and two player version of this set up. 

The removable peg controller idea seems a little tough, and potentially not what we want the interaction to look like, so there will be updates on the physical side of the game coming soon.


## A Plinko Prototype!

The goal of this first prototype is to get a version of the 'game' plinko up and running inside of unity with working physics and a decent organizational scheme. I accidentally made the perfect 2000's era desktop screen saver but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## A Trash Game Idea:

For the next project, we will be pushing it a bit farther with more thorough development and fabrication. 

My project idea is for a trash machine plinko game where players can remove physical pegs and replace them with tricked out ones that help move the falling items around to sort them. The initial concept for this involves 3 bins, one for trash, one for compost and one for recycling.

The goal of the game is to correctly sort the most materials before the time runs out, and players will recieve tickets for how well they accomplish this. 

Below are some basic sketches of this idea.
